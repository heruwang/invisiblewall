Separation of immigrant families is like an invisible cage both to the people who are in the cage and outside the cage. Millions of families cannot reunite. It could feel even more lonely being in the city when everyone only focuses on one’s own life and remains ignorant on injustice. Are you going to keep walking away, or pause for a second and see what is around you. Try to target the circle to the cage, you will help the immigrant families destroy the invisible wall. Are you willing to help?</p>

  <p>Artist Statement: Distance can never be reached even through technology. Separation cannot be overcome when you remain ignorant. Separation of immigrant families is like an invisible cage both to the people who are in the cage and outside the cage. Millions of families cannot reunite. It could feel even more lonely being in the city when everyone only focuses on one’s own life and remains ignorant on injustice.
